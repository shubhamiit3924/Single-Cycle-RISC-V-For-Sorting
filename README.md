The purpose of this project was to create a basic and compact processor which uses RISCV (32 bit) type instructions. The entire code is in a single file its compact and minimalistic in nature. There are basic instruction programs in the IMEM itself to affirm the functionality of the processor. These programs are

simple counter loop
finding maximum in the given dataset
bubble sort implementation.
insertion sort implementation
Using this as an approximation for better performing processors, we can get an understanding of the relative perfomance of different sorting algorithms, by tracking the number of cycles and read writes taken. I have made this easy to observe using the testbench provided. The testbench can be a handy tool for users to gain a rudimentary understanding of the functioning of single and doubly nested loops
